# Uncap This: Megastructures
This Stellaris mod uncaps the Dyson Sphere and Matter Decompressor megastructures, and replaces the uninhabitable segments of ring worlds with habitable segments (effectively tripling the number of planets). Ring worlds can now also be constructed in systems with habitable planets, do be careful not to dematerialize colonized planets though, as your pops probably cannot breathe vacuum.
